## Hi there
This is a simple python script which I wrote to minimise no. of clicks to get my beloved book and also send it to my kindle without using data cable or composing an email !
Well this script downloads any book entered in the Query in .pdf and .mobi format

##_RUN_ 
	* `python main.py`
	* Fill up the configg file if you want to send the downloaded file to your kindle, No issues if not

## Dependencies
	* beautifulsoup
	* smtplib ( to send email )
